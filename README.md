# Analysis-of-Malaria-Journal-Articles
This project aims to analyze articles published in the Malaria Journal, a leading publication in the field of malaria research.
Project Introduction and Objectives
The Malaria Journal is a peer-reviewed open-access medical journal covering research on malaria, a disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes.
It publishes original research articles, reviews, and commentaries from scientists and researchers worldwide.
Analyzing articles from the Malaria Journal is crucial for staying updated on the latest research findings and breakthroughs in the field of malaria.
Understanding the current landscape of malaria research can inform public health policies, treatment strategies, and future research directions.

# Key Objectives of the Project:
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. In this project, we used web scraping to gather article data from the Malaria Journal website.

Key step in web scraping:
created function which take published year as input parameter and scraps the journal 
Scrapper scans each journal from the website 
used xpath which scraps the useful information
Preprocessed the raw html using rvest and stringr

# Data Analysis 

Summary of Data Analysis:
After scraping article data from the Malaria Journal, we will conduct several analyses to gain insights into trends and patterns in malaria research.

Significance of Analysis:
Understanding trends and patterns in malaria research is crucial for guiding future research directions, public health policies, and intervention strategies.
Analyzing keyword frequency helps identify emerging topics and areas of interest within the field.

# Visualization 

Interpretation and Key Findings:
The bar chart will displays the frequency of keywords mentioned in the articles published in the Malaria Journal.
The most common keywords include "malaria," "vector control," "drug resistance," and "mosquitoes."
This visualization highlights the key topics and themes covered in the articles, providing insights into the current research priorities in malaria research.
By visualizing keyword frequency, researchers can identify emerging trends, areas of interest, and gaps in knowledge within the field of malaria research.

Significance of the Visualization:
The visualization helps researchers and policymakers understand the breadth and depth of research topics covered in the Malaria Journal.
It enables stakeholders to prioritize research areas, allocate resources effectively, and develop targeted interventions to address critical issues in malaria control and prevention.
By visualizing keyword frequency, stakeholders can stay informed about the latest developments and innovations in malaria research, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes.
